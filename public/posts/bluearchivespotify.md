# How to Get Official Blue Archive OST On Spotify

I bet 1 million dollars that if you're not inside Japan or Korea right now and you try to open [this Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/album/0BTiFYoYsuKefaM1HIQqCC), it won't let you play any content inside it.
###### Did I win?

I first had a question about why I was unable to listen to the official Blue Archive soundtracks on Spotify, and had to result in using either YouTube or Soundcloud as an alternative *just* to listen to them.

I decided to investigate further, and saw that **Blue Archive OST has region locked access to Japan and Korea on Spotify.**

To solve this, we must first take a look at what's stopping *you* from accessing the soundtracks in the first place.

As you can see from the image above, your Spotify account region is displayed in your Spotify account settings (which you can go to if you click on the image). However, *you can also change your region to another region.* 

There's a problem with this though. You can't just switch to any region you want to. Spotify only lets you switch to a region if you're there if it detects your location to be in the country. For this tutorial, we are aiming to switch to the **Japan** region.

## Step 1: Acquire a VPN
> **IMPORTANT**: This VPN MUST have the ability to switch to any place **inside Japan**.
> 
> A good VPN for iOS that a friend recommended that has this functionality is [VPN cat](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/vpnネコ-無制限のトラフィックを備えた高速で簡単なvpn/id1134784923) (this is not an advertisement I swear).

> You can follow these instructions on a mobile or desktop device!

## Step 2: Change Your Region

Once you acquire your VPN that's able to switch to Japan, you're going to want to turn it on, then go to [your Spotify account settings](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/profile/) and go to your **Edit Profile** tab, under the **Account** panel.

> When I did it, my browser changed the language to Japanese because it thought I was actually Japanese. If you're having trouble navigating through the settings page, you should try to follow these instructions without the VPN on first, then try again with the VPN on.

When you're there, go to the **Country or region** dropdown menu (as seen in the picture above) and switch your region to Japan (which should be the only other region in the dropdown menu than your current one). Once you've done this, **make sure to click the big green button that saves your changes**.

## Step 3: Confirm It Works

After you've change your region, you're free to turn the VPN off and experiment with your Spotify to check that it works. Open one of the official Blue Archive Playlists (for example, the one that I definitely won the bet on at the top of this post) and see if you can play anything in it! 

If it doesn't work the first time, try logging in and logging out of the session for it to refresh your region in the cache.

> If this method didn't work, I wouldn't know why, since it worked for me the first time 😎

## Step 4: Enjoy Your Blue Archive Beats
Hoorray!!!! You got Blue Archive working on your Spotify account! Now we can all enjoy this nice music together.
